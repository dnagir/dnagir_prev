      <h2><a href='#vision' name='vision'>Software development is an art and the result is an invention</a></h2>
      <img src="images/puzzle.jpg" alt="The Perfection" class='righty' />
      <p>
        I believe the software development process can be excellent, same way as its result - the great art - the product.
        Software development is not only a process and boring mechanical work, but it <em>is an art</em>.
        It is the art of creating incredible solutions and producing great ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many times have you seen the solutions that amazed you?
        How often do you come up with things that wow others?
        And most importantly, what do you feel then?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that feeling comparable to the unimaginable inventions of
        <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci' target='_blank'>Leonardo da Vinci</a>?
        If you answer <q>Yes</q>, then you are probably very passionate about developing new cool things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been trying to create a perfect solution for any problem.
        Unfortunately there is no such so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, I believe it <em>is</em> possible to create excellent and perfect solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All it takes is just to:
          <ol>
            <li>Define what <q>perfect</q> means.</li>
            <li>Figure out how to reach the perfection and excellence.</li>
          </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        So I hope some day I will be able to achieve that. But for now I will try to promote the ideas:
        <ul>
          <li>the software development process is an art;</li>
          <li>we can excel doing art;</li>
          <li>an art can be perfect;</li>
          <li>we should strive to create perfect art, even against all the resistance we face.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2><a href='#portfolio' name='portfolio'>Portfolio</a></h2>
      <img src="images/portfolio.png" alt="Portfolio" class="righty" />
      <p>
        So far I have delivered a number of projects and neither of them is <q>perfect</q> the way I want it to be.
        But definitely each of them is closer to being perfect then all the previous ones.

      <h2><a href='#about' name='about'>Dmytrii Nagirniak who is Dmitriy Nagirnyak and other variations</a></h2>
      <img src='images/me.jpg' alt='Myself' class='righty' />
      <img src='images/nina.jpg' alt="My Honey Wife" class='lefty' />
      <p>
        My name has been misspelled so many times, starting from my passport and ending on the streets.
        Nobody can get it right. So I do not even bother anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you care, the correct one is <q>Dmytrii Nagirniak</q> (can a normal person pronounce it? huh?), I also used <q>Dmitriy Nagirnyak</q> on the net.
        My friends usually just cal me <q>Dima</q> which is the shortest and probably easiest one.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Anyway, I am a very passionate software engineer currently living in Aussieland (Melbourne).
        I <em>do</em> care about all the products I develop and I want to make them perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my career in 2003, when I was a student in Uni.
        The University IT department invited me to participate in the development of educational software applications.
      </p>            
      <p>
        Since then, I gained experience in a number of programming languages and technologies,
        and recently came to conclusion that I just love web and want to <em>develop for the web</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love the <em>Test Driven Development</em> and believe that in many, many years from now it will become the de-facto standard.
        Something that we will not even notice anymore. It will just <em>be</em> (as today Internet just IS).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more than all the cool things, I love my wife, Nina, who infinitely supports me in every possible situation and takes care of <q>The Home</q>.
        She is energetic and loving life person who likes children and languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is the one without whom I cannot imagine my life.
